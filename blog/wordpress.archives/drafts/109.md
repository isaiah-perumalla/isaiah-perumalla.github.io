# Memory Management algorithms - Reference counting

Having worked on a number of projects which have strict throughput and /or latency requirements, I have to come to realize,regardless if your are on a managed or unmanaged platform, it essential to have a broad understanding of basic memory management algorithms when performance matters. Armed with a broad overview of various algorithms it much easier to make informed decision on writing and tuning application.
