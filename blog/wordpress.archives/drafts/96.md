# Revisiting Balanced Trees

Balanced search trees are extremely useful data structure that are often used as the underlying implementation of symbol tables or dictionaries which maintain the order of the elements based on their keys. While we for most cases we may not have to implement these from scratch, there are case , you would want to implement an augmented version of a balance search tree to achieve efficient inserts and lookups queries on when dealing with large amounts of data. For example on of my recent projects we had items which had a start date and an end date (a date interval).
