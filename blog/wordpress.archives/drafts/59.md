# Overview of modern hardware and Memory Systems

[Chapter7.1-Memory1](http://isaiahperumalla.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/chapter7-1-memory1.pdf)In my recent projects I have been involved with very low latency, high performance systems, when developing systems with very low latency requirements I have realized it is crucial to understand how your code interacts with modern hardware architectures in particular we need to understand the costs of accessing data from hierarchical memory systems found in almost all modern hardware. Its well known there is a growing disparity between the CPU speed and memory speed, where access to memory is becoming the 'bottleneck'. On modern hardware the most common way of handling this is disparity is by introducing memory hierarchies in the hardware as show in the diagram below.
